C     | C preprocessor "execution environment" supporting        |
C     | flags. Use this file to set flags controlling the        |
C     | execution environment in which a model runs - as opposed |
C     | to the dynamical problem the model solves.               |
C     | Note: Many options are implemented with both compile time|
C     |       and run-time switches. This allows options to be   |
C     |       removed altogether, made optional at run-time or   |
C     |       to be permanently enabled. This convention helps   |
C     |       with the data-dependence analysis performed by the |
C     |       adjoint model compiler. This data dependency       |
C     |       analysis can be upset by runtime switches that it  |
C     |       is unable to recoginise as being fixed for the     |
C     |       duration of an integration.                        |
C     |       A reasonable way to use these flags is to          |
C     |       set all options as selectable at runtime but then  |
C     |       once an experimental configuration has been        |
C     |       identified, rebuild the code with the appropriate  |
C     |       options set at compile time.                       |

C     In general the following convention applies:
C     ALLOW  - indicates an feature will be included but it may
C     CAN      have a run-time flag to allow it to be switched
C              on and off.
C              If ALLOW or CAN directives are "undef'd" this generally
C              means that the feature will not be available i.e. it
C              will not be included in the compiled code and so no
C              run-time option to use the feature will be available.
C
C     ALWAYS - indicates the choice will be fixed at compile time
C              so no run-time option will be present

C=== Macro related options ===
C--   Control storage of floating point operands
C     On many systems it improves performance only to use
C     8-byte precision for time stepped variables.
C     Constant in time terms ( geometric factors etc.. )
C     can use 4-byte precision, reducing memory utilisation and
C     boosting performance because of a smaller working set size.
C     However, on vector CRAY systems this degrades performance.
C     Enable to switch REAL4_IS_SLOW from genmake2 (with LET_RS_BE_REAL4):

C--   Control use of "double" precision constants.
C     Use D0 where it means REAL*8 but not where it means REAL*16

C--   Enable some old macro conventions for backward compatibility

C=== IO related options ===
C--   Flag used to indicate whether Fortran formatted write
C     and read are threadsafe. On SGI the routines can be thread
C     safe, on Sun it is not possible - if you are unsure then
C     undef this option.

C--   Flag used to indicate whether Binary write to Local file (i.e.,
C     a different file for each tile) and read are thread-safe.

C--   Flag to turn off the writing of error message to ioUnit zero

C--   Alternative formulation of BYTESWAP, faster than
C     compiler flag -byteswapio on the Altix.

C--   Flag to turn on old default of opening scratch files with the
C     STATUS='SCRATCH' option. This method, while perfectly FORTRAN-standard,
C     caused filename conflicts on some multi-node/multi-processor platforms
C     in the past and has been replace by something (hopefully) more robust.

C--   Flag defined for eeboot_minimal.F, eeset_parms.F and open_copy_data_file.F
C     to write STDOUT, STDERR and scratch files from process 0 only.
C WARNING: to use only when absolutely confident that the setup is working
C     since any message (error/warning/print) from any proc <> 0 will be lost.

C=== MPI, EXCH and GLOBAL_SUM related options ===
C--   Flag turns off MPI_SEND ready_to_receive polling in the
C     gather_* subroutines to speed up integrations.

C--   Control MPI based parallel processing
CXXX We no longer select the use of MPI via this file (CPP_EEOPTIONS.h)
CXXX To use MPI, use an appropriate genmake2 options file or use
CXXX genmake2 -mpi .
CXXX #undef  1

C--   Control use of communication that might overlap computation.
C     Under MPI selects/deselects "non-blocking" sends and receives.
C--   Control use of communication that is atomic to computation.
C     Under MPI selects/deselects "blocking" sends and receives.

C--   Control XY periodicity in processor to grid mappings
C     Note: Model code does not need to know whether a domain is
C           periodic because it has overlap regions for every box.
C           Model assume that these values have been
C           filled in some way.

C--   disconnect tiles (no exchange between tiles, just fill-in edges
C     assuming locally periodic subdomain)

C--   Always cumulate tile local-sum in the same order by applying MPI allreduce
C     to array of tiles ; can get slower with large number of tiles (big set-up)

C--   Alternative way of doing global sum without MPI allreduce call
C     but instead, explicit MPI send & recv calls. Expected to be slower.

C--   Alternative way of doing global sum on a single CPU
C     to eliminate tiling-dependent roundoff errors. Note: This is slow.

C=== Other options (to add/remove pieces of code) ===
C--   Flag to turn on checking for errors from all threads and procs
C     (calling S/R STOP_IF_ERROR) before stopping.

C--   Control use of communication with other component:
C     allow to import and export from/to Coupler interface.

C--   Activate some pieces of code for coupling to GEOS AGCM

C
C     ALWAYS - indicates the choice will be fixed at compile time

C     Flag used to indicate which flavour of multi-threading
C     compiler directives to use. Only set one of these.
C     USE_SOLARIS_THREADING  - Takes directives for SUN Workshop
C                              compiler.
C     USE_KAP_THREADING      - Takes directives for Kuck and
C                              Associates multi-threading compiler
C                              ( used on Digital platforms ).
C     USE_IRIX_THREADING     - Takes directives for SGI MIPS
C                              Pro Fortran compiler.
C     USE_EXEMPLAR_THREADING - Takes directives for HP SPP series
C                              compiler.
C     USE_C90_THREADING      - Takes directives for CRAY/SGI C90
C                              system F90 compiler.






C--   Define the mapping for the _BARRIER macro
C     On some systems low-level hardware support can be accessed through
C     compiler directives here.

C--   Define the mapping for the BEGIN_CRIT() and  END_CRIT() macros.
C     On some systems we simply execute this section only using the
C     master thread i.e. its not really a critical section. We can
C     do this because we do not use critical sections in any critical
C     sections of our code!

C--   Define the mapping for the BEGIN_MASTER_SECTION() and
C     END_MASTER_SECTION() macros. These are generally implemented by
C     simply choosing a particular thread to be "the master" and have
C     it alone execute the BEGIN_MASTER..., END_MASTER.. sections.

CcnhDebugStarts
C      Alternate form to the above macros that increments (decrements) a counter each
C      time a MASTER section is entered (exited). This counter can then be checked in barrier
C      to try and detect calls to BARRIER within single threaded sections.
C      Using these macros requires two changes to Makefile - these changes are written
C      below.
C      1 - add a filter to the CPP command to kill off commented _MASTER lines
C      2 - add a filter to the CPP output the converts the string N EWLINE to an actual newline.
C      The N EWLINE needs to be changes to have no space when this macro and Makefile changes
C      are used. Its in here with a space to stop it getting parsed by the CPP stage in these
C      comments.
C      #define IF ( a .EQ. 1 ) THEN  IF ( a .EQ. 1 ) THEN  N EWLINE      CALL BARRIER_MS(a)
C      #define ENDIF    CALL BARRIER_MU(a) N EWLINE        ENDIF
C      'CPP = cat $< | $(TOOLSDIR)/set64bitConst.sh |  grep -v '^[cC].*_MASTER' | cpp  -traditional -P'
C      .F.f:

C--   Control storage of floating point operands
C     On many systems it improves performance only to use
C     8-byte precision for time stepped variables.
C     Constant in time terms ( geometric factors etc.. )
C     can use 4-byte precision, reducing memory utilisation and
C     boosting performance because of a smaller working
C     set size. However, on vector CRAY systems this degrades
C     performance.
C- Note: global_sum/max macros were used to switch to  JAM routines (obsolete);
C  in addition, since only the R4 & R8 S/R are coded, GLOBAL RS & RL macros
C  enable to call the corresponding R4 or R8 S/R.



C- Note: a) exch macros were used to switch to  JAM routines (obsolete)
C        b) exch R4 & R8 macros are not practically used ; if needed,
C           will directly call the corrresponding S/R.

C--   Control use of JAM routines for Artic network (no longer supported)
C     These invoke optimized versions of "exchange" and "sum" that
C     utilize the programmable aspect of Artic cards.
CXXX No longer supported ; started to remove JAM routines.
CXXX #ifdef LETS_MAKE_JAM
CXXX #define CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8 ( a, b) CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8_JAM ( a, b)
CXXX #define CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8 ( a, b ) CALL GLOBAL_SUM_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XY_RS ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XY_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XY_RL ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XY_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XYZ_RS ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XYZ_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #define CALL EXCH_XYZ_RL ( a, b ) CALL EXCH_XYZ_R8_JAM ( a, b )
CXXX #endif

C--   Control use of "double" precision constants.
C     Use d0 where it means REAL*8 but not where it means REAL*16

C--   Substitue for 1.D variables
C     Sun compilers do not use 8-byte precision for literals
C     unless .Dnn is specified. CRAY vector machines use 16-byte
C     precision when they see .Dnn which runs very slowly!

C--   Set the format for writing processor IDs, e.g. in S/R eeset_parms
C     and S/R open_copy_data_file. The default of I9.9 should work for
C     a long time (until we will use 10e10 processors and more)

C                   termination.
C     ThError     - Thread detected an error.
C     usingMPI    - Flag controlling use of MPI routines. This flag
C                   allows either MPI or threads to be used in a
C                   shared memory environment which can be a useful
C                   debugging/performance analysis tool.
C     usingSyncMessages - Flag that causes blocking communication to be used
C                         if possible. When false non-blocking EXCH routines
C                         will be used if possible.
C     notUsingXPeriodicity - Flag indicating no X/Y boundary wrap around
C     notUsingYPeriodicity   This affects the communication routines but
C                            is generally ignored in the numerical model
C                            code.
C     threadIsRunning, threadIsComplete - Flags used to check for correct behaviour
C                                         of multi-threaded code.
C                                         threadIsRunning is used to check that the
C                                         threads we need are running. This catches the
C                                         situation where a program eedata file has nTthreads
C                                         greater than the setenv PARALLEL or NCPUS variable.
C                                         threadIsComplete is used to flag that a thread has
C                                         reached the end of the model. This is used as a check to
C                                         trap problems that might occur if one thread "escapes"
C                                         the main.F master loop. This should not happen
C                                         if the multi-threading compilation tools works right.
C                                         But (see for example KAP) this is not always the case!

C     mpiTagE       - Tags are needed to mark requests when MPI is running

C     mpiTagS         is a neighbor in more than one direction. The tags ensure that
C     mpiTagN         a thread will get the message it is looking for.
C     mpiTagSW        The scheme adopted is to tag messages according to
C     mpiTagSE        the direction they are travelling. Thus a message
C     mpiTagNW        travelling east is tagged mpiTagE. However, in a
C     mpiTagNE        multi-threaded environemnt several messages could
C                     be travelling east from the same process at the
C                     same time. The tag is therefore modified to
C                     be mpiTag[EWS...]*nThreads+myThid. This requires that
C                     each thread also know the thread ids of its "neighbor"

C                   termination.
C     ThError     - Thread detected an error.
C     usingMPI    - Flag controlling use of MPI routines. This flag
C                   allows either MPI or threads to be used in a
C                   shared memory environment which can be a useful
C                   debugging/performance analysis tool.
C     usingSyncMessages - Flag that causes blocking communication to be used
C                         if possible. When false non-blocking EXCH routines
C                         will be used if possible.
C     notUsingXPeriodicity - Flag indicating no X/Y boundary wrap around
C     notUsingYPeriodicity   This affects the communication routines but
C                            is generally ignored in the numerical model
C                            code.
C     threadIsRunning, threadIsComplete - Flags used to check for correct behaviour
C                                         of multi-threaded code.
C                                         threadIsRunning is used to check that the
C                                         threads we need are running. This catches the
C                                         situation where a program eedata file has nTthreads
C                                         greater than the setenv PARALLEL or NCPUS variable.
C                                         threadIsComplete is used to flag that a thread has
C                                         reached the end of the model. This is used as a check to
C                                         trap problems that might occur if one thread "escapes"
C                                         the main.F master loop. This should not happen
C                                         if the multi-threading compilation tools works right.
C                                         But (see for example KAP) this is not always the case!

C     mpiTagE       - Tags are needed to mark requests when MPI is running

C     mpiTagS         is a neighbor in more than one direction. The tags ensure that
C     mpiTagN         a thread will get the message it is looking for.
C     mpiTagSW        The scheme adopted is to tag messages according to
C     mpiTagSE        the direction they are travelling. Thus a message
C     mpiTagNW        travelling east is tagged mpiTagE. However, in a
C     mpiTagNE        multi-threaded environemnt several messages could
C                     be travelling east from the same process at the
C                     same time. The tag is therefore modified to
C                     be mpiTag[EWS...]*nThreads+myThid. This requires that
C                     each thread also know the thread ids of its "neighbor"

C     | This routine does the actual formatting of the data
C     | and printing to a file. It assumes an array using the
C     | MITgcm UV indexing scheme and base index variables.
C     | User code should call an interface routine like
C     | PLOT\_FIELD\_XYRS( ... ) rather than this code directly.
C     | Text plots can be oriented XY, YZ, XZ. An orientation
C     | is specficied through the "plotMode" argument. All the
C     | plots made by a single call to this routine will use the
C     | same contour interval. The plot range (iMin,...,byStr)
C     | can be three-dimensional. A separate plot is made for
C     | each point in the plot range normal to the orientation.
C     | e.g. if the orientation is XY (plotMode = PRINT\_MAP\_XY).
C     |      kMin =1, kMax = 5 and kStr = 2 will produce three XY
C     |      plots - one for K=1, one for K=3 and one for K=5.
C     |      Each plot would have extents iMin:iMax step iStr
C     |      and jMin:jMax step jStr.

C     | o Does textual mapping printing of a field.
C     *==========================================================*
C     | This routine does the actual formatting of the data
C     | and printing to a file. It assumes an array using the
C     | MITgcm UV indexing scheme and base index variables.
C     | User code should call an interface routine like
C     | PLOT\_FIELD\_XYRL( ... ) rather than this code directly.
C     | Text plots can be oriented XY, YZ, XZ. An orientation
C     | is specficied through the "plotMode" argument. All the
C     | plots made by a single call to this routine will use the
C     | same contour interval. The plot range (iMin,...,byStr)
C     | can be three-dimensional. A separate plot is made for
C     | each point in the plot range normal to the orientation.
C     | e.g. if the orientation is XY (plotMode = PRINT\_MAP\_XY).
C     |      kMin =1, kMax = 5 and kStr = 2 will produce three XY
C     |      plots - one for K=1, one for K=3 and one for K=5.
C     |      Each plot would have extents iMin:iMax step iStr
C     |      and jMin:jMax step jStr.
